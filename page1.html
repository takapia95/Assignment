      <p>At the beginning of the World Wide Web there was only HTML, and web pages were a bit drab compared to what we
        are used to seeing today. Now modern web pages rely on three technologies, which will be the main focus of this
        book. </p>

      <ol class="upper">
        <li>HTML ‚Äì Hyper Text Markup Language ‚Äì HTML describes the content of the page, giving the page some sctructure
          including common things like headings, and sections, and lists of things.</li>
        <ol class="lower">
          <li class="p1"> HTML </li>
          <li class="p2">Markdown </li>
          <li class="p1"> restructuredText </li>
        </ol>
        <li>CSS ‚Äì Cascading Style Sheets ‚Äì CSS desribes the ‚Äúlook‚Äù of the page, the colors, the fonts, the margins, etc.
          There are three ways to include CSS in your html document.</li>
        <ol class="lower">
          <li class="p2">You can add a style attribute to a tag. This should not be used very often, if ever!</li>
          <li class="p1">You can embed your CSS in your file inside a style tag. We‚Äôll use this method in this book for
            convenience.</li>
          <li class="p2">You can put all of your CSS in a separate style file and include the style file into your HTML.
            This is the preferred way of doing it because it achieves the greatest amount of separation between the
            content and how the content looks.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Javascript is used to change the behavior of the page. What happens when you click on a button, or scroll a
          scrollbar, or hover over something with your mouse.</li>
        <ol class="lower">
          <li class="p1">Although we have been calling HTML and CSS programming languages, they do not have nearly the
            power of Javascript. Once you learn Javascript you could can write any program that could be written.</li>
          <li class="p2">Javascript is a procedural language. With HTML and especially CSS the order of things is not
            always important, but with Javascript, the order that you do things in is very important. Javascript is also
            called an object oriented language.</li>
